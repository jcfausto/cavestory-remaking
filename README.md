Implementing a game (based on Limeoats' tutorials on youtube) to remember some c++. 

## 26/06/2017

So far, aproximately 24 hours of effort were invested over the period of 16 days to complete Limeoats' youtube lessons. 

Now, I'll continue on my own, adding more functionality, refactoring some parts of the code, optimizing some logics, fixing some bugs, etc.

Also, I'll experiment some concepts of game development using this hobby project here.
